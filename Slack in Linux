The Snaps are software packages that contain all the dependencies and files to run. These packages can be installed via the Ubuntu Software Center or via the terminal. 

In fact, Slack is not an open source application and, for this reason, it is not included in the official Ubuntu repositories.

First, connect to your machine via an SSH connection. If you haven't done so yet, following our guide is recommended to  connect securely with the SSH protocol. In case of a local computer, go to the next step and open your machine terminal.

Once inside, run the command:

$ sudo snap install slack --classic

In this way, Slack will be installed on your computer and it will be possible to use it right away. In addition, the software will automatically update when necessary.

Certainly, the installation can be performed by searching for the program on the Ubuntu Software Center.
Installing the software via the Deb package

From the Slack download page, the latest .deb package can be viewed and downloaded using the wget command ,  for example:

$ 
wget https://downloads.slack-edge.com/linux_releases/slack-desktop-4.12.2-amd64.deb

Once the download is completed, simply open the file and follow the installation wizard. To install the program provide some permissions and preferences.

With the installation of Slack, the Skype libraries, which can later be updated through the Ubuntu Update Manager, are usually also installed too.
Starting Slack

Now that Slack has been installed, start the software from the command line by simply typing:

$ slack
